# LampixJS

LampixJS is the official JavaScript library for creating [Lampix](https://lampix.com/) applications, making use of the internal API Lampix devices expose.

The library is meant to be used inside the context of a Lampix device or the Lampix simulator. Loaded inside an environment without the expected API will simply make the library search for the API indefinitely, rendering its most relevant methods unusable.
