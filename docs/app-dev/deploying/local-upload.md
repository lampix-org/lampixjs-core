# Local App Upload

### Prerequisites

* Lampix and a development machine in the same network

### Uploading

* Create a `.zip` file with the structure outlined [here](./application-structure.md)
* Find out Lampix's IP
* Open a web browser on the development machine
* Go to `http://<ip>:8888/apps`
* Click the first button to select a `.zip` file
* Click upload - there should be a message like "Upload successful!"
* Restart Lampix - uploading new apps does not have immediate effect in order to not disrupt currently running experiences
