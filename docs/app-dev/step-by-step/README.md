# Step by step app

This example will showcase registering the most common watchers and how to use them, step by step.

**IMPORTANT**: At the time of this writing, this example simply showcases the steps to build an app, but it is meant to run only in the simulator, as fruits is not a neural network we currently provide.

It will be provided in the future, with oranges, lemons and limes at first, and the app adjusted to take into account the varying sizes of the physical elements. Right now, the size isn't taken into consideration.
