* [@lampix/dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lampix/dom) - need a DOM button on the fly? Use the `buttons.generate(x, y, callback) functionality
* [@lampix/screensaver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lampix/screensaver) - shameless Lampix plug in the form of a screensaver, in case you want your application to go in a stand-by mode after a number of seconds, using only `screensaver.initialize(numberOfSeconds)`, where `numberOfSeconds` specifies how long to wait after the last action until the screensaver comes up
